## FAQ

### Organizational

#### Which language will we be using?

You can use either Python,R, or Julia. We will only provide examples and support in R, though.  



#### What software do I need to install?

You will need to use git, and a text editor or IDE.

For git, please see [here](https://math-517.github.io/math_517_website/resources/tutorials/github.qmd) for instructions on how to install it.

You can use any kind of text editor or IDE you like. We recomment using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the extension corresponding to your language of choice. You can also use [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for R. See [here](https://math-517.github.io/math_517_website/resources/tutorials/installing_software.qmd) for instructions on how to install the software and IDEs.

#### How do I submit an assignment?

We will be using Github-classroom to distribute and collect assignments. You will need to create a Github account if you don't already have one.


### Technical issues

#### I am lost with Github, what should I do?

GitHub has possibly the best tutorials and documentation of any software out there. You can find the [Hello world](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) there. Most of the time googling your issue will lead you to the right place.


#### I have bugs in my code/ something doesn't work/ I don't know how to do something, what should I do?

First google your issue. 90 times out of 100 this will solve your issues. Another 9% can be resolved by reading the documentation of 
the software you are using. For the very last percent you can ask your question during the exercises hours. 


#### I cannot find the repository linked to the assignment, what should I do?

At the top of each assignment there should be a link you can manually click to accept the assignment. Links will also be provided on Moodle. If this happens *after* the first assignment, please let us know.
